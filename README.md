# LLogistics â€“ Deterministic Route Optimization

## Introduction:
The main goal of this project is to make an operation research study into the possible exhaustion of resources if a trendy American Consumer Goods firm were to invest into outsourcing their production and distrubution into the europe markets. By utilizing the AMPL/CPLEX mathematical programming software I built models for optimization and analysis of results. The firm is rapidly trying to bleed into booming European markets starting with metropolitan cities such as Milan, Italy and other cities all over Italy, specifically the top 25 cities with the highest population in Italy. The same can be repeated for other countires in Europe as well given neccessary information can be obtained.
